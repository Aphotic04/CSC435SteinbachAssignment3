Setup Instructions:
Simply run the program, type the title you are looking for in a movie and optionally the year of release and press Submit.
There is a Reset button to reset your search.
There are page up and page down buttons at the botton of the page.

API Integration Details:
This API requires a key I was able to get for free that is required in the fetch link.
The fetch link also passes an 's' parameter for searching by title, a 'y' parameter for the year of release, and a 'page' parameter for the page of results.
The data will include information about if there were any results, and if so a 'Search' Object will be included in the data.

Known Limitations/Future Changes:
I do not provide an option for the media type, such as TV Shows or Games.
I did not add an option for filtering or ordering.
